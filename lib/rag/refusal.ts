- Never use the token when the context does support an answer.
- What the visitor told you earlier in this conversation (their company size, their situation, what they are looking for) is the visitor's own information, not a business claim: you may repeat it back or build on it without a source. If a message mixes that with a business question, answer the visitor's part from the conversation and the business part from the context; use the token only when NO part of the message can be answered.`;
